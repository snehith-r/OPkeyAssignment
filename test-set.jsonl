That propensity we still see today, therefore, you cannot be upset if he looks for prey independently and, for example, digs in the garden. With proper guidance, a Staby is a gentle dog and a great friend for life.Stabys are also very inquisitive. Always pay attention to what a Stabyhoun is up to because with their inquisitive nature, they can quickly get into trouble. If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no “surprises” in store before calming down again.This breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands. The majority of Stabyhouns are black and white. The brown and white coloring is seen in the Netherlands, but the orange and white Stabyhoun is nearly extinct. The Staby’s build is such that it is greater in length than in height and similarly, the head shows more length than width. The feathering on his chest, collar, forelegs, trousers and tail gives the Staby the impression of being longhaired, but the coat is not excessively long. The Stabyhoun is considered to be an “all-around” dog, with abilities in hunting, retrieving, and pointing. They are also ideal family dogs because of their size and affectionate character.

Strong and well-muscled, but more elegant than bulky, there’s an honest, no-frills look about them, as befit dogs built to work hard for their feed. A breed hallmark is the proud carriage of the head. Coat colors range from a rich fawn to mahogany. The black ears and mask accentuate bright, questioning eyes the color of dark Belgian chocolate.If you have ever seen a Mal perform an obedience routine, you know firsthand what a smart and eager breed this is. Problems set in, though, when this people-oriented dog is underemployed and neglected. Exercise, and plenty of it, preferably side by side with their adored owner, is key to Mal happiness. The smart, confident, and versatile Belgian Malinois is a world-class worker who forges an unbreakable bond with his human partner. To deny a Mal activity and the pleasure of your company is to deprive him of his very reasons for being.\ntemperament: Confident, Smart, Hardworking\npopularity: 43\nmin_height: 55.88\nmax_height: 66.04\nmin_weight: 18.1436948\nmax_weight: 36.2873896\nmin_expectancy: 14.0\nmax_expectancy: 16.0\ngroup: Herding Group\ngrooming_frequency_value: 0.4\ngrooming_frequency_category: Weekly Brushing\nshedding_value: 0.6\nshedding_category: Seasonal\nenergy_level_value: 0.8\nenergy_level_category: Energetic\ntrainability_value: 0.8\ntrainability_category: Easy Training\ndemeanor_value: 0.4\ndemeanor_category: Reserved with Strangers\nlifespan: 15.0","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I am curious about the lifespan of a Belgian Malinois."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":31,"topic":"Dog Breeds"}}

They learn quickly and are ready for any activity their owners engage in. While they will still keep the family farm and home free of rats and mice, the job for which they were bred, they also excel in companion sports such as agility and obedience. They get along with other dogs without belligerence and have retained their prey drive without obsessive compulsion. At the end of the day, they love nothing better than to share the love and companionship of their owners. Teddies can adapt to pretty much any lifestyle, whether you show in conformation rings, work in agility trials, or just want a great companion for your home or farm. Their small to medium size make them suitable to apartment living as well. This loyal, active and playful breed is at its best as a member of its human family.

With his strong protective nature and well-developed pack instincts, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier gets along well with children (when raised with them), cats, and other dogs. He is a bold, tenacious hunter with seemingly unlimited energy whose size and endurance makes him an excellent hunter of squirrels and vermin.\ntemperament: Playful, Versatile, Intelligent\npopularity: 0\nmin_height: 20.32\nmax_height: 38.1\nmin_weight: 3.62873896\nmax_weight: 11.33980925\nmin_expectancy: 14.0\nmax_expectancy: 16.0\ngroup: Miscellaneous Class\ngrooming_frequency_value: 0.4\ngrooming_frequency_category: Weekly Brushing\nshedding_value: 0.6\nshedding_category: Seasonal\nenergy_level_value: 0.8\nenergy_level_category: Energetic\ntrainability_value: 1.0\ntrainability_category: Eager to Please\ndemeanor_value: 0.8\ndemeanor_category: Friendly\nlifespan: 15.0","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"I am interested in knowing what activities Teddy Roosevelt Terriers excel in, other than keeping homes free of rats and mice."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":252,"topic":"Others"}}
