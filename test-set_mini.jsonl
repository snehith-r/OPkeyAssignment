That propensity we still see today, therefore, you cannot be upset if he looks for prey independently and, for example, digs in the garden. With proper guidance, a Staby is a gentle dog and a great friend for life.Stabys are also very inquisitive. Always pay attention to what a Stabyhoun is up to because with their inquisitive nature, they can quickly get into trouble. If you think your Staby will sit quietly if something happens, you will often be disappointed. Although Stabys make a lot of noise when something is wrong or to alert his owner, they generally expect the owner to further investigate before they accept that things are normal. Most Stabys will need to verify that there are no “surprises” in store before calming down again.This breed is a functional and powerfully-built pointing dog that originated in the Netherlands. The majority of Stabyhouns are black and white. The brown and white coloring is seen in the Netherlands, but the orange and white Stabyhoun is nearly extinct. The Staby’s build is such that it is greater in length than in height and similarly, the head shows more length than width. The feathering on his chest, collar, forelegs, trousers and tail gives the Staby the impression of being longhaired, but the coat is not excessively long. The Stabyhoun is considered to be an “all-around” dog, with abilities in hunting, retrieving, and pointing. They are also ideal family dogs because of their size and affectionate character.
